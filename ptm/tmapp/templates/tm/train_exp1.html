<p>Thank you for agreeing to help us with this translation job! We are a group of researchers in <a href="http://cs.stanford.edu" target="_blank">Computer Science Department at Stanford University</a> working on interfaces for translation. While you work, this website will record your keystrokes and mouse actions. <b>No other information will be recorded, except for the survey data below.</b> We will study the method that you and other translators like you used to translate sentences.</p>

<p>You will be asked to translate two sets of sentences from {{ src_lang }} to {{ tgt_lang }}. Translate the sentences as quickly and as accurately as you can. Each translation must be completed in at least 10 minutes, but we expect that you will require significantly less time. We estimate that you will need no more than an hour to complete the job. If you finish the job in less than an hour, you will still be paid the full price.</p>

<p>This job is the first in a series of translation studies that we are running over the next few months. If you submit good translations, then we will ask you to join us for future studies.</p>

<h2>Overview of the Job</h2>
<p>This website will administer the translation job, which is organized into two blocks separated by a break:</p>

<ul>
<li>Translation Block #1 (about 30min.) </li>
<li>Break (untimed) </li>
<li>Translation Block #2 (about 30min.) </li>
</ul>

<p>We ask that you complete the whole job in a single session. Once you complete Block #1, the website will prompt you to take a break, and the timer will be disabled. Get up, go to the bathroom, get some coffee: whatever you need to stay productive. We expect that you'll take about 15 minutes, and no more than an hour. We require that you complete both blocks on the same day.</p>

<p>The text that you will be asked to translate comes from several unrelated documents. We selected paragraphs from these documents, the sentences of which you will see in the order in which they appeared in the document.</p>

<p>When creating your translation, please do not use:
<ul>
<li>Machine translation systems (for example, Google Translate, Trados, etc.)</li>
<li>Browser plugins or extensions</li>
</ul>
You <b>may</b> use dictionaries, either online (for example, <a href="http://www.wordreference.com" target="_blank">WordReference</a>) or offline.
</p>

<p>We will check the translations you submit against those produced by various machine translation systems. We will also review the screenshots of your work on odesk to verify that you did not use any other form of machine assistance. We're curious to know how humans work. We already know a lot about machines ;-) Please help us by not using machine assistance.</p>

<p>Each translation Block has a different interface. The website will randomly choose which interface to show you in each of the translation Blocks.</p>

<h2>Translation Interface A</h2>
<p>You will be presented with a sentence and an empty textbox. Please enter a translation as quickly and as accurately as you can. A timer at the bottom left of the screen will indicate how much time you have to complete the job. If you do not complete the translation before the timer expires, then the incomplete translation will be submitted for you. The site will then redirect you to the next translation task.</p>

<h2>Translation Interface B</h2>
<p>You will be presented with a sentence and a suggested translation. You may use the suggested translation as a starting point. However, the objective remains the same: translate the sentence as quickly and as accurately as you can. If you believe that it would be faster to type a new translation than to fix the suggestion, then feel free to delete the suggestion and start from the beginning.</p>

<p>We're almost there. Please complete this survey. When you click the button below, you will see Interface A, followed by Interface B. Take your time to familiarize yourself with the interfaces. When you click "OK" on Interface B, you will be re-directed to the first Block.</p>
