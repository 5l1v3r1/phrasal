To create the database dump, make sure that the .pgpass file is correct. Then run:

$ pg_dump -h localhost -U django djangodb > djangodb.dump

To load the dump, create a new empty database (e.g., 'ptm') and run:

$ psql -h locahost ptm postgres < djangodb.dump

For more info on dump and restore, see:
