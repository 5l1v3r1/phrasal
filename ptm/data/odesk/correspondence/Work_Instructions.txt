A tutorial will explain the experiment to you. Read the tutorial carefully, and if you have any questions, please send me a note on odesk *before* you start the translation job.

**Please remember to run the odesk team tracker software.**

Browser issues:
We would prefer that you use a recent version of Chrome, Safari, or Firefox. If you use Internet Explorer, please ensure that you are using version 8 or later. If you absolutely cannot use any of these browsers, please send me a note before you begin. We have only tested the software with these browsers.

Payment:
I'll review your work during the week and make the payment this weekend.

Thanks again, and feel free to contact me with *any* questions!
Spence
