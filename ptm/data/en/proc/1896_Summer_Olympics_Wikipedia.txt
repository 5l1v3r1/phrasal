The 1896 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the I Olympiad, was a multi-sport event celebrated in Athens, Greece, from 6 to 15 April 1896. 
It was the first international Olympic Games held in the Modern era. 
Because Ancient Greece was the birthplace of the Olympic Games, Athens was perceived to be an appropriate choice to stage the inaugural modern Games. 
Despite many obstacles and setbacks, the 1896 Olympics were regarded as a great success. 
The Games had the largest international participation of any sporting event to that date. 
The Panathinaiko Stadium, the only Olympic stadium used in the 19th century, overflowed with the largest crowd ever to watch a sporting event. 
The highlight for the Greeks was the marathon victory by their compatriot Spyridon Louis. 
The most successful competitor was German wrestler and gymnast Carl Schuhmann, who won four events.
