The physicist Arthur Eddington drew on Borel's image further in The Nature of the Physical World (1928), writing: If I let my fingers wander idly over the keys of a typewriter it might happen that my screed made an intelligible sentence. 
If an army of monkeys were strumming on typewriters they might write all the books in the British Museum. 
The chance of their doing so is decidedly more favourable than the chance of the molecules returning to one half of the vessel.
These images invite the reader to consider the incredible improbability of a large but finite number of monkeys working for a large but finite amount of time producing a significant work, and compare this with the even greater improbability of certain physical events.
Any physical process that is even less likely than such monkeys' success is effectively impossible, and it may safely be said that such a process will never happen.
