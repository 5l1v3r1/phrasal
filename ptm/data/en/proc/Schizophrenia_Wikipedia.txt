A person diagnosed with schizophrenia may experience hallucinations (most reported are hearing voices), delusions (often bizarre or persecutory in nature), and disorganized thinking and speech. 
The latter may range from loss of train of thought, to sentences only loosely connected in meaning, to incoherence known as word salad in severe cases. 
Social withdrawal, sloppiness of dress and hygiene, and loss of motivation and judgment are all common in schizophrenia.
There is often an observable pattern of emotional difficulty, for example lack of responsiveness.
Impairment in social cognition is associated with schizophrenia,as are symptoms of paranoia; social isolation commonly occurs.
In one uncommon subtype, the person may be largely mute, remain motionless in bizarre postures, or exhibit purposeless agitation, all signs of catatonia.
Late adolescence and early adulthood are peak periods for the onset of schizophrenia, critical years in a young adult's social and vocational development.
In 40% of men and 23% of women diagnosed with schizophrenia, the condition manifested itself before the age of 19.
