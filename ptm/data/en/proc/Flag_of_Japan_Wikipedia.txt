Starting in 1870, flags were created for the Japanese Emperor (then Emperor Meiji), the Empress, and for other members of the imperial family.
At first, the emperor's flag was ornate, with a sun resting in the center of an artistic pattern. He had flags that were used on land, at sea, and when he was in a carriage. 
The imperial family was also granted flags to be used at sea and while on land (one for use on foot and one carriage flag). 
The carriage flags were a monocolored chrysanthemum, with 16 petals, placed in the center of a monocolored background.
These flags were discarded in 1889 when the Emperor decided to use the chrysanthemum on a red background as his flag. 
With minor changes in the color shades and proportions, the flags adopted in 1889 are still in use by the imperial family.
