In other words, "provoking disbelief in free will" probably causes a belief in fatalism. 
As discussed earlier in this article, compatibilistic free will is illustrated by statements like "my choices have causes, and an effect - so I affect my future", whereas fatalism is more like "my choices have causes, but no effect - I am powerless".
Fatalism, then, may be what threatens people's sense of self-efficacy. 
Lay people should not confuse fatalism with determinism, and yet even professional philosophers occasionally confuse the two. 
It is thus likely that the negative consequences below can be accounted for by participants developing a belief in fatalism when experiments attack belief in "free will".
To test the effects of belief in determinism, future studies would need to provide articles that do not simply "attack free will", but instead focus on explaining determinism and compatibilism. 
Some studies have been conducted indicating that people react strongly to the way in which mental determinism is described, when reconciling it with moral responsibility. 
Eddy Nahmias has noted that when peoples actions are framed with respect to their beliefs and desires (rather than their neurological underpinnings) they are more likely to dissociate determinism from moral responsibility.
