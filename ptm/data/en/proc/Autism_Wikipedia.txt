Social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders (ASD; see Classification) from other developmental disorders.
People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. 
Noted autistic Temple Grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals, or people with normal neural development, as leaving her feeling "like an anthropologist on Mars".
Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood. 
Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. 
Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms; for example, they have less eye contact and turn taking, and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as the deficiency to point at things.
Three- to five-year-old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others.
