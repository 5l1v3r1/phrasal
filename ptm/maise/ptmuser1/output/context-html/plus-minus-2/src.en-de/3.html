      Starting in 1870, flags were created for the Japanese Emperor (then Emperor Meiji), the Empress, and for other members of the imperial family.<br>
      At first, the emperor's flag was ornate, with a sun resting in the center of an artistic pattern. He had flags that were used on land, at sea, and when he was in a carriage.<br>
      <b>The imperial family was also granted flags to be used at sea and while on land (one for use on foot and one carriage flag).</b><br>
      The carriage flags were a monocolored chrysanthemum, with 16 petals, placed in the center of a monocolored background.<br>
      These flags were discarded in 1889 when the Emperor decided to use the chrysanthemum on a red background as his flag.<br>
