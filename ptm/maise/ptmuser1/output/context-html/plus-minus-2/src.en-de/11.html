      Social withdrawal, sloppiness of dress and hygiene, and loss of motivation and judgment are all common in schizophrenia.<br>
      There is often an observable pattern of emotional difficulty, for example lack of responsiveness.<br>
      <b>Impairment in social cognition is associated with schizophrenia,as are symptoms of paranoia; social isolation commonly occurs.</b><br>
      In one uncommon subtype, the person may be largely mute, remain motionless in bizarre postures, or exhibit purposeless agitation, all signs of catatonia.<br>
      Late adolescence and early adulthood are peak periods for the onset of schizophrenia, critical years in a young adult's social and vocational development.<br>
