      Because Ancient Greece was the birthplace of the Olympic Games, Athens was perceived to be an appropriate choice to stage the inaugural modern Games.<br>
      Despite many obstacles and setbacks, the 1896 Olympics were regarded as a great success.<br>
      <b>The Games had the largest international participation of any sporting event to that date.</b><br>
      The Panathinaiko Stadium, the only Olympic stadium used in the 19th century, overflowed with the largest crowd ever to watch a sporting event.<br>
      The highlight for the Greeks was the marathon victory by their compatriot Spyridon Louis.<br>
