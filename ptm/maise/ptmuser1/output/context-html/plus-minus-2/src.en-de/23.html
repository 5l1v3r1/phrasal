      It was the first international Olympic Games held in the Modern era.<br>
      Because Ancient Greece was the birthplace of the Olympic Games, Athens was perceived to be an appropriate choice to stage the inaugural modern Games.<br>
      <b>Despite many obstacles and setbacks, the 1896 Olympics were regarded as a great success.</b><br>
      The Games had the largest international participation of any sporting event to that date.<br>
      The Panathinaiko Stadium, the only Olympic stadium used in the 19th century, overflowed with the largest crowd ever to watch a sporting event.<br>
