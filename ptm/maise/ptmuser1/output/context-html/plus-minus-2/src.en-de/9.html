      A person diagnosed with schizophrenia may experience hallucinations (most reported are hearing voices), delusions (often bizarre or persecutory in nature), and disorganized thinking and speech.<br>
      The latter may range from loss of train of thought, to sentences only loosely connected in meaning, to incoherence known as word salad in severe cases.<br>
      <b>Social withdrawal, sloppiness of dress and hygiene, and loss of motivation and judgment are all common in schizophrenia.</b><br>
      There is often an observable pattern of emotional difficulty, for example lack of responsiveness.<br>
      Impairment in social cognition is associated with schizophrenia,as are symptoms of paranoia; social isolation commonly occurs.<br>
