      These flags were discarded in 1889 when the Emperor decided to use the chrysanthemum on a red background as his flag.<br>

      <b>A person diagnosed with schizophrenia may experience hallucinations (most reported are hearing voices), delusions (often bizarre or persecutory in nature), and disorganized thinking and speech.</b><br>
      The latter may range from loss of train of thought, to sentences only loosely connected in meaning, to incoherence known as word salad in severe cases.<br>
      Social withdrawal, sloppiness of dress and hygiene, and loss of motivation and judgment are all common in schizophrenia.<br>
