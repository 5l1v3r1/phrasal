      The chance of their doing so is decidedly more favourable than the chance of the molecules returning to one half of the vessel.<br>
      These images invite the reader to consider the incredible improbability of a large but finite number of monkeys working for a large but finite amount of time producing a significant work, and compare this with the even greater improbability of certain physical events.<br>
