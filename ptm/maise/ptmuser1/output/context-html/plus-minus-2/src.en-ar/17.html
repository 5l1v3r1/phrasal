      The physicist Arthur Eddington drew on Borel's image further in The Nature of the Physical World (1928), writing: If I let my fingers wander idly over the keys of a typewriter it might happen that my screed made an intelligible sentence.<br>
      If an army of monkeys were strumming on typewriters they might write all the books in the British Museum.<br>
      <b>The chance of their doing so is decidedly more favourable than the chance of the molecules returning to one half of the vessel.</b><br>
      These images invite the reader to consider the incredible improbability of a large but finite number of monkeys working for a large but finite amount of time producing a significant work, and compare this with the even greater improbability of certain physical events.<br>
      Any physical process that is even less likely than such monkeys' success is effectively impossible, and it may safely be said that such a process will never happen.<br>
