      <b>Starting in 1870, flags were created for the Japanese Emperor (then Emperor Meiji), the Empress, and for other members of the imperial family.</b><br>
      At first, the emperor's flag was ornate, with a sun resting in the center of an artistic pattern. He had flags that were used on land, at sea, and when he was in a carriage.<br>
      The imperial family was also granted flags to be used at sea and while on land (one for use on foot and one carriage flag).<br>
