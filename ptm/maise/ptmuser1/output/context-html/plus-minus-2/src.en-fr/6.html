      The carriage flags were a monocolored chrysanthemum, with 16 petals, placed in the center of a monocolored background.<br>
      These flags were discarded in 1889 when the Emperor decided to use the chrysanthemum on a red background as his flag.<br>
      <b>With minor changes in the color shades and proportions, the flags adopted in 1889 are still in use by the imperial family.</b><br>
