      These images invite the reader to consider the incredible improbability of a large but finite number of monkeys working for a large but finite amount of time producing a significant work, and compare this with the even greater improbability of certain physical events.<br>
      Any physical process that is even less likely than such monkeys' success is effectively impossible, and it may safely be said that such a process will never happen.<br>
      <b>The 1896 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the I Olympiad, was a multi-sport event celebrated in Athens, Greece, from 6 to 15 April 1896.</b><br>
      It was the first international Olympic Games held in the Modern era.<br>
      Because Ancient Greece was the birthplace of the Olympic Games, Athens was perceived to be an appropriate choice to stage the inaugural modern Games.<br>
