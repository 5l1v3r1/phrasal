      The imperial family was also granted flags to be used at sea and while on land (one for use on foot and one carriage flag).<br>
      The carriage flags were a monocolored chrysanthemum, with 16 petals, placed in the center of a monocolored background.<br>
      <b>These flags were discarded in 1889 when the Emperor decided to use the chrysanthemum on a red background as his flag.</b><br>
      With minor changes in the color shades and proportions, the flags adopted in 1889 are still in use by the imperial family.<br>
