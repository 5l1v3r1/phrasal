Miss World pageant once again in South Africa
After a month-long trek across South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World are preparing to enter the final straight on Saturday to make their dream come true: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
During this grand beauty congregation organised for the second consecutive year around Johannesburg, five of them have already landed their tickets to the semi-final.
Miss Japan, Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gibraltar, and Yanbing Ma from Canada have been elected Miss World Sportswoman or also Miss World Top Model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind.
To visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Cape Town is extraordinary.
I saw so many things and I have so much new experience, said Miss of Sierra Leone.
This competition, which is taking place in South Africa for the ninth time, will be transmitted live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I could not have dreamed of a better country to award my crown.
The experience was fascinating.
I am pleased to have been able to live it twice, points out Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second visit to South Africa has been made memorable by the many talks with candidates and the re-discovery "of landscapes in this country that take your breath away".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press meetings, and safaris, the Miss candidates are concentrating on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and present at this vote, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom have become stars of Bollywood.
It is the dream of every woman to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not all about appearance.
We are ambassadors for our countries and I want to return home with the crown, asserts Miss India with a broad smile.
According to organisers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
Candidates will parade in traditional outfits and, of course, in swimsuits.
The show will be presented by Angela Chow, an ethnic Chinese television presenter, the South African ex-beauty queen Michelle McLean, and an officer from the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa showed that it could welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is difficult to better, affirms Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates went on safari, as they did last year, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bicycle, and sampled the local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met the South African president, Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Unusual for a head of State, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory will probably be the World Cup draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for football in June 2010, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I have mixed with people I never thought I would be able to approach.
I will without a doubt be returning for the 2010 World Cup, enthuses Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive", according to son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive", assures his son, David, on Friday arriving at the airport in Los Angeles, where he was to be by his father's bedside, who has been in hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, all will go well, declared his son, David Hallyday, to the Press on leaving the plane from Paris just after 13:00 local time (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son had a relaxed air and assured that he would be heading "without delay" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection stemming from a slipped disc operation on November 26th in Paris.
The singer was "put in an artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for comfort reasons, to prevent his suffering, and to allow his treatment to be administered", indicated the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been put in an artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted on Monday for an infection stemming from a slipped disc operation on the 26th of November in Paris.
The singer had to be operated on in the night from Wednesday to Thursday because of significant lesions resulting from the operation.
His wife, Laeticia, went on Friday morning to the Los Angeles French High School, where their daughter Jade is enrolled, to attend a school performance, observed an AFP photographer.
The Head of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery of the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to see the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer vehemently brought into question Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neuro-surgeon, who operated on the singer on the 26th of November at the International Clinic of Parc Monceau in Paris.
They told us it was carnage.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were aghast, declared Mr. Camus.
I heard talk of possible legal proceedings to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus reckoned that Johnny Hallyday had "left far too soon for Los Angeles, with the Paris surgeon's authorisation".
I had this doctor on the phone in person, and he assured me that there was no problem for this trip, which shocked me, as I, myself, have had two slipped discs, he added.
Shortly before, on RTL, he had indicated that the singer apparently "had left without a drain or anything", following his Paris operation.
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is well-known in artistic circles.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at the time.
In 2007, he had also operated on the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a haematoma, following a cerebral haemorrhage.
However, he is also a doctor with a notorious reputation, convicted by the Law on several occasions, in cases of medical liability, as well as for fraud and tax evasion.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer for the Doctors' governing body, accused him of being "a man without scruples", who "regularly" has to answer to the governing body's Council, and who is "far from reputable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made an announcement on Friday through his solicitor, David Koubbi.
The latter indicated that the operation had "gone perfectly well" and that post-operation tests returned "normal".
The operation "was not haemorrhagic and therefore did not required a drain to be fitted", he added.
In any case, the singer's tour, for whom health problems have been multiplying since the summer, would seem to be on hold.
Clearly, resuming the tour on the 8th of January [in Amiens] as planned seems very soon, declared Mr. Camus.
The UDF alliance speaks out and orders the New Centre party to stop using its acronym
The UDF alliance, controlled by François Bayrou's Democratic Movement (MoDem), reacted on Friday to the buy-out bid made by the New Centre's president, Hervé Morin, for the acronym of the former Giscardian party, by ordering him not to use it under any circumstances, threatening legal action otherwise.
Hervé Morin announced publicly that he intended to recoup the UDF acronym, ruling that François Bayrou was not worthy of its political heritage, having extended his hand to the Left.
The Defence Minister, whose party is partner to the UMP, had in fact planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC's national Council.
In support of his move, he received backing from deputy Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP switched to NC), who claims his ownership of the UDF trademark by being the first to record it in 2004 at the National Industrial Property Institute.
However, Friday evening, the UDF Alliance's office, headed by François Bayrou's friends, who do not plan to give up possession, has come out of silence to launch an attack against the deputy, ordering him not to use the acronym, and to transfer the trademark's ownership to them, otherwise threatening legal action.
In the last few days, you have stepped up the number of declarations indicating that you were going to propose political action to regain the UDF acronym, the alliance writes in a communication signed by 19 out of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from the MoDem, as well as the senator, Jean Arthuis, from the centre Alliance.
You also thought it acceptable to include in your campaign literature and on your website's homepage the movement's name, the New Centre, and to follow it with the slogan: today's UDF, remark those who signed the document.
As you are well aware, you have no right to the use of the acronym, explains the UDF's office, requiring that the NC remove "immediately any mention of the UDF name from all material, and from (their) internet site".
He also requests that Hervé de Charette "transfer ownership of the trademark to its rightful owners".
If you failed to do this, the matter would be referred to the courts to ensure that the Law and the legitimate rights of UDF members were respected, warn the document's signatories.
In their communication, they specify that the UDF "is a political movement in its own right since 1978" and points out that Mr. Morin and his friends had "made their choice" to leave him in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002, to establish the UMP".
The New Centre, according to them, has therefore no right to the use of the UDF acronym (Union for French Democracy).
They also remind that the UDF's last assembly voted in 2007 for its union with the MoDem for three years, and for the creation of an office charged with defending "the material and moral interests" of the body founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the trademark", he had "not been a UDF member for three years", but, in fact, with the UMP.
He is profiting in a scandalous and fraudulent manner from the absence of a registered trademark for the UDF acronym by taking it to benefit his own account.
This incident is turning into a major offence, they state, before adding ironically about the NC's strategy that: "in our opinion, in politics as in real life, it is more dignified to make one's own name rather than try to become somebody by fraudulently acquiring a name we have no right to".
Liliane Bettencourt Case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for "abuse of weakness"
The Nanterre tribunal decided on Friday to bring François-Marie Banier to trial to ascertain whether, as the daughter of billionairess Liliane Bettencourt is accusing him, he profited from the eighty-year-old's weakened mental state to despoil her of some of her fortune.
The photographer, 62, known for his photographs of the stars, will be tried on the 15th and 16th of April 2010 for "abuse of weakness", an offence that carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a 375 000 euro fine.
The decision confirms that there will indeed be a trial in this case, which is turning into a worthy family saga involving one of the richest families in France, where mother and daughter are torn apart, while at the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
However, the 15th Magistrate's Court has also ordered a combined expert medical opinion of Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87, to be led by three doctors.
The heiress and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such an exam, at least not with the conditions proposed by the Nanterre court at the time of the investigation.
The doctors nominated on Friday will have to submit a report by the 10th of March, 2010, stating, in particular, whether Liliane Bettencourt could have found herself in a weakened state and at which times.
I think she will submit to it.
I will talk with her about it, declared Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, at the exit of the hearing.
For his part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, congratulated himself on the court's decision.
It is excellent news (…) The expert opinion will prove that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this elderly lady, whom we should be protecting, he affirmed.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's daughter and only child has engaged in taking to court the case against François-Marie Banier, the photographer and all-round artist, whom she accuses of profiting for years from her mother's weakness to obtain a billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts, or works of art.
As far as she is concerned, Liliane Bettencourt has always refuted having been manipulated by the photographer, who she considers a long-standing friend.
As the court on Friday was due to examine the admissibility of the case brought by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the pleas from the lawyers at times turned proceedings into an unveiling of intimate family matters.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer cited three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003, and 2005) to her solicitor, in which she expressed having suspicions about Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the letter dated from 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Mr. Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years."
I have been unable to speak to Françoise since her marriage".
For its part, the Court in Nanterre has again ruled that the plaintiff's claim was not admissible for action, all the more so after a judge supervising guardianship refused her request in the past few days to initiate a procedure allowing legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully capable of participating in legal proceedings, she is not under protection and does not have a guardian.
Nobody needs to act on her behalf", affirms the Public Prosecution's representative, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The Court determined that it would make a ruling once the case concerning the admissibility of Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers's claim had taken place.
A management revolution or the end of competitive intelligence?
If nothing changes in the way France's biggest enterprises are run, our fight for the development of competitive intelligence will have been in vain…
For over ten years, the Management's attitude in large enterprises towards their employees reflects the position of enterprises and their consumers before the marketing revolution: employees should be made to adhere to "values" dictated from above just as it was in the past, when products dreamed up by the factory's engineers were dropped on the consumer.
By placing the consumer at the heart of the organisation, the marketing revolution put the strategies for conquering markets the right way up again... even if authoritarian temptation to impose products, which are disconnected from the preferences of the consumer tend to resurface regularly!
A demobilisation of employees can lead to terminal demoralisation.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the visible part of a far more widespread problem that affects management employees in particular.
Demobilisation gravely compromises the development of an organisation's strategic functions, notably in R&D, but even more so in competitive intelligence.
Indeed, CI "demands from all sides concerned (...) a proactive approach and a long-term vision"; it requires from employees a commitment that is entirely contradicted by authoritarian management methods.
For this reason, we are calling for a management revolution, which would consist in placing employees at the centre of an enterprise's concerns alongside consumers.
The very relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Will internal opinion surveys - such as those given by Orange to its employees - stimulate this revolution in managerial methods?
Unfortunately, I fear it will not.
- Firstly, because I have witnessed that, when faced with a new situation, any organisation will arrive, after many detours, at doing chiefly... what it always does!
- Next, because authoritarianism - a disease of power - grows proportionally with the magnitude of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behaviour.
Coming from the top technical educational establishments, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, for intellectual convenience, the old behaviourist theory, which has recently been re-awakened by the "neuro-sciences" of the United States that have been widely and silently diffused by business institutes and the Media.
In this way, by suggesting that "levers" [sic] can be pulled for the commitment of management staff, a recent Ipsos survey published on Figaro.fr cradles leaders into a position of mechanistic governance, which is unsuited to the world of today.
Identify and quantify mobilisation factors
In contrast, the management revolution needed for the correct functioning of modern enterprises supposes the adoption of a finalistic vision of human behaviour.
It consists in the integration, within all management strategies and practices, of a fundamental admission: for employees, commitment to the enterprise is only possible if it is clearly perceived as a means to realising a part of their dreams, their ambitions, and their plans.
Currently, only studies produced through motivation factor analysis adopt the concept of employee motivation.
These studies have demonstrated that they form a view of their organisation based on a pre-determined consensus of opinion, which allows them, by means of this perceived view, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life plans.
By identifying and gauging these mobilisation factors, enterprise leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and turn their management of resources "the right way round".
They thereby create a favourable terrain for the concerted development of robust and effective competitive intelligence.
Oslo speech: the "just war" earns Obama praise from the Right
The American Right paid tribute to the speech given the previous evening in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 had defended the concept of a "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives, who had mocked the awarding of the Prize to Obama on October 9th, were this time giving the presidential speech their applause, lead by Sarah Palin, former vice-president candidate during the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, declared Mrs. Palin, right-wing champion of the Republican party, to the daily newspaper USA Today, adding that she had herself touched on the topic of war that is "sometimes necessary" in her memoirs, which have just been published.
War is, of course, one of the last things, which Americans want to get involved in, but it is necessary.
We must stop these terrorists over there, she affirmed.
Mr. Obama, who has inherited the two wars from his predecessor, George W. Bush, in Iraq and Afghanistan, applied himself on Thursday in Oslo to justifying resorting to force, a way to explain his decision to send 30 000 additional troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another one of Mr. Obama's opponents, Newt Gingrich, concluded that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found his speech to be really very good, approved the former Speaker in the House of Representatives, who had particularly valued the mention that "Evil does exist in the world" in the presidential discourse.
From certain viewpoints, I found this speech to be of historic significance, declared Mr. Gingrich, during an interview for the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former representative, considered by some a possible candidate for the Republican inauguration of the 2012 presidential elections, was delighted to see "a president from the Left" remind the Noble Committee members "that they would not be free and in a position to award a peace prize if resorting to force had not been an option".
For Michael Gerson, a former writer for George W. Bush and re-converted columnist for the Washington Post, Mr. Obama has given "a very American speech".
As well as presenting himself as a "world citizen", as "he always does", "he spoke like an American President", reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble, which they did not create and they are doing little to preserve", declared Mr. Gerson.
Among the few unconvinced right-wingers, a hawkish character from the Bush era, the former UN ambassador, John Bolton, described the speech as "drab, turgid, and uninspired" on the National Review Online's website.
To the president's left, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify resorting to force.
When we wrap war inside the notion of justice, the massacre of innocent people can easily be justified, he warned.
Centre-left Press nevertheless remained full of praise for the president.
The Los Angeles Times, still of the opinion that the Nobel Prize had been prematurely awarded to Mr. Obama, described his address as "a blockbuster", even for a speaker that is known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a roadmap for guiding international decisions made on conflicts, poverty and oppression", enthused the Californian newspaper.
Mr. Obama "made the speech that was needed", reports the New York Times, judging it "both sombre and edifying".
Road freight: three marathons for one agreement to save Christmas deliveries
Following three marathon sessions of negotiations, transport unions and the TLF, the only employer's organisation to have remained to the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening that will end the strike order and the threat on Christmas deliveries.
During the signing on Friday evening, Transport Secretary Dominique Bussereau was "delighted" with the agreement after several rounds of negotiations on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, negotiating sides left in the small hours with the hope of a swift signing of the agreement's text later in the morning.
And this, despite three employers' organisations (FNTR, UNOSTRA, OTRE) having slammed the door.
However, it took a further six hours from a meeting that started at 11am for everyone to be in agreement, and for the text to be signed at 6pm.
The disagreement "would have been very damaging for the companies" and "it looked like it might threaten the end of year festivities", Mr. Bussereau stated.
The document allows for a 4% increase in salaries for the lowest ones (in local and regional road transport), and a 2.9% increase for higher ones (international transport).
Hourly rates, for those on lower pay, "go from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It is not much, but we have come a long way, explains Patrice Clos (Worker's Union).
This evening we will give the order to our campaigners not to form blockades or picket at delivery depots.
There may, however, always be a few difficult ones, who remain uncooperative, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, paid tribute to "a good agreement", even if it was "difficult to concede the increases on the higher salaries given international competition".
According to him, the increases will be of the order of 170 euros per month for the lower salaries and from 100 to 120 euros for the higher ones.
It is a common sense agreement, respecting the workers, declared Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) praised it as "a historic agreement".
As for Richard Jaubert (CGT), he described it as "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also allows for a rise in travel expenses of 3% and maintaining current general road transport conditions for the first half of 2010, which will give room for dealing with the questions of a 13th month's pay and the modernisation of the collective labour agreement.
Mr. Bussereau reminded everyone that "a 100 million euro cut in employers' charges" had been the subject of a Government amendment in corrective financial legislation for 2009, voted on in the night from Thursday to Friday at the National Assembly.
The Government will ask that the Senate vote on it "in the same timeframe".
The signature from the TLF allows the agreement to be applied in the first instance to all the companies that are members of the organisation, and secondly, to the whole profession, subject to it being extended by the Minister for Labour.
It will be done "in a very short time", assures Mr. Bussereau.
The opposing employers' organisations can only delay the process.
The FNTR called it a "sham", because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector in compensation for part of the carbon tax".
The Transport Secretary urgently forced us to the negotiating table, not with the aim of a two-sided review, but to avoid upsetting the turkey-eaters this Christmas, deplores the UNOSTRA.
For the OTRE, the agreement risks "digging the graves of a large number of the sector's SMEs over the next 12 months".
RER A: disruptions this weekend, unions unhappy with RATP proposals
Disruptions on the RER A, the largest urban public transport link in France, are set to continue over the weekend, as a meeting on Friday, the second day of strikes, between the unions and the RATP management have left their pay demands unmet.
Saturday and Sunday, on this critical weekend of shopping before Christmas, trains will only run between the hours of 10am and 8pm, with just one out of two trains running on the central stretch (between La Défense and Nation), and one out of four outside the central section.
The operation of the interchange with the SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Préfecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette, who welcome 200 000 customers every day, were delighted by the fact that "the RATP is making efforts to assist the department stores".
The RER A runs through the Parisian conurbation from West to East.
The RATP segment runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, approximately one out of two trains ran at peak times, with almost no trains at all during off-peak periods, as planned.
As on Thursday, there was no trouble with crowds on the platforms, as Parisians had gotten themselves organised.
Thus, in the early hours, the station at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less busy than usual, notably because of the absence of school and college students.
At Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had gotten up "an hour and a half earlier, to be sure of arriving on time".
The Saint-Lazare station did not see any overcrowding, the SNCF stated, having planned for additional support staff and police officers.
The RER A trains operated by the SNCF to or from Cergy-Le-Haut were departing or arriving from Saint-Lazare station, where they link with the metro.
New general meetings for strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will review the results, seen as "poor" by the unions, of a meeting with Management held on Friday afternoon.
The RER's director proposes to negotiate a specific agreement for the RER A on all aspects, working hours, career paths, etc…
It is not what the drivers, who are demanding the bonus they are owed, want, according to Thierry Garon (SUD).
The RATP has even put its offer of bonuses on hold, the CGT complained, pointing out that the management "could not be bothered to resolve the problem, whereas road transport and the SNCF both have it done and dusted".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for "a wider review of the conditions of practice for the profession", the RATP elaborated.
Prompting the unions to remark further that the company "did not care about its weekend passengers".
During the morning, some 150 drivers invaded a works council meeting at the company's seat in Paris.
That is when Management, which had until then refused to enter into any discussions during the strike, had suggested the meeting "in a motion to calm the situation".
The dispute is threatening to extend to RER B on Tuesday, following the submission of an advance notice by the UNSA and the Indépendants groups.
The unions are demanding a bonus of 120 euros (UNSA) to 150 euros, with a 30-euro variable band (CGT, FO, CFDT, SUD, Indépendants) and are complaining of the deterioration in work conditions on this line serving a million passengers every day.
The RER drivers, all in the later stages of their careers, are paid a gross salary of 2200 to 2700 euros as well as 600 to 650 euros of bonus pay for split shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice bans the pro-Kurd party, a decision laden with consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court returned a verdict on Friday for the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurd party, a decision which was immediately followed by angry protests within the Kurdish community in the Southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
The decision is likely to greatly complicate the Government's work, as it has just recently made positive gestures towards the Kurdish community in an attempt to resolve a 25-year old conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was disbanded because it had become "a hotbed of damaging activities against the State's independence and its unfailing unity", the President of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, declared to the press at the end of four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a majority of seven was sufficient to force the disbanding, Mr. Kiliç indicated, adding that 37 of the party's representatives, including its president, Ahmet Türk, and the deputy, Aysel Tugluk, have been banished from political life for the next five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity, from which both Mr. Türk and Mrs. Tugluk benefited, and the confiscation of party assets by the Treasury.
The DTP occupies 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned prior to the verdict that the representatives would leave Parliament rather than take their seats as representatives with no affiliation.
The decision was taken following proceedings launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Appeal Court, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying "directives" from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is considered to be a terrorist organisation by Ankara and in many countries.
Many observers believe the DTP serves as a legal political shop window for the PKK rebels.
The party maintains, however, that it has "no organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to recognise it as a terrorist organisation and is calling for the Government to open negotiations with it.
The court's verdict comes at a time when the Government has extended its hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures, reinforcing its rights in an attempt to quash Kurdish support for the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
DTP leaders had stated that a dissolution of the party could lead to renewed tensions in the Anatolian Southeast, where a great number of protests against the terms for the detention of the PKK's head, Abdullah Öcalan, have degenerated into clashes with police in the last few weeks.
As soon as the Law made its announcement, a thousand protesters gathered before the DTP's buildings in Diyarbakir, the Southeast's main city, populated mainly by Kurds.
Police forces fired tear-gas grenades and used water cannons, as demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails and stones with slings.
Around a hundred people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
Following the verdict, Mr. Türk declared that the Law's decision would "deepen the despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this [Kurdish] issue by banning a party, he told the Press.
The Government, a party rooted in Islamic influences, also condemned the decision.
We are opposed on principle to the closing down of parties.
It does not solve anything, declared the Energy Minister, Taner Yildiz.
This decision puts a blowtorch to the Government's democratic olive branch, comments political analyst Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers in the North of Turkey three days earlier, one of the bloodiest in the last few months.
A new Silicon Valley
For many years, it was a secret city, inaccessible to Westerners.
Zelenograd, one of ten districts in the capital Moscow, was a highly guarded location for secret arms research during the Soviet Union.
Nowadays, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from Moscow centre is regarded as Russia's Silicon Valley.
Important research and production facilities for micro and nano technology are located here.
In September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd made contacts with the Frankfurt science centre in Riedberg - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several visits, and on Wednesday Zelenograd and Riedberg finally signed a "protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt on Wednesday.
The Moscow Deputy Mayor, Yuri Roslyak, and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Zelenograd led the Russian delegation and Economic Affairs Head Edwin Schwarz signed on behalf of Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of the FIZ and small- and medium-sized companies focusing on research in natural science will travel to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
The idea is to establish continuous scientific exchange.
But business relations are also being eyed.
Companies of the FIZ will have the option to get a foothold in the growing Russian market.
In turn, Russian businesses want to win orders in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters to the most important Russian research institutes and companies.
These include, for instance, the Moscow Institute of Electrophysics, and major companies such as Sitronics and Rossiyskaya Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (verbatim "green city") got its name from the wooded hills where the research facilities are located.
A Stuttgart brake block
The impact and dimensions of Stuttgart 21 cannot be overestimated.
For its supporters, the project deals no less than with the "new heart of Europe".
Quite rightly so. S21 is far more than lowering a railway station, more than a gigantic construction project, which will plunge the city of the Baden-Württemberg state capital into a terrible chaos of building sites for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 warn born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminus stations with rails ending in the middle of towns were regarded as fossils of the 19th century in terms of traffic technology, which acted like brake blocks to contemporary rail traffic, as it used to take an awful lot of time to shift engines from back to front.
Pull in, stop briefly, pull out - that's the plan.
And therefore, terminus stations were supposed to disappear: as in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a non-terminus station, which is approximately half way along the trans-European rail line between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 is actually being built now, although the vision of the 1980s has no longer been compatible with the reality for years.
Even very ambitious planners have recognised that it is virtually unpayable to lower the stations in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria.
Terminus stations also no longer have pulling in and out problems since the development of push-pull trains with railway traction units and control cabs at either end.
And still: Stuttgart 21 along with the new ICE route to Ulm is now being started.
State and municipal politicians have enforced it.
German Rail is participating, also because the risks of the Republic's biggest single infrastructure project will be borne by the taxpayer and not the state company.
As regards urban development, the development can be more or less justified.
An urban area is being created which, if the planners' computer-generated graphics are to be believed, will feature a lot of green.
For the rail traffic system, S21 is damaging.
The non-terminus railway station and the line extension are designed for passenger transportation, which - typical for the 1980s - is estimated to see huge growth.
At the time, there was no competition from no-frills airlines.
Contemporary traffic policy, however, should be prioritising the handling of freight transportation, as transport by rail far more environmentally friendly than by lorry on the road.
