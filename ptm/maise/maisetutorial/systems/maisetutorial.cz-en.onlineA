Due to the serious damage caused by this compels, had to be a singer at night from Wednesday to Thursday again operován.

Shortly before the station Radio RTL stated that singer seems to fly after the Paris operation without drénu, without anything ".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the art circles.

In 2007 operoval also herečku Charlotte Gainsbourgovou to delete hematomu, arising as a result of bleeding into the brain.

The Association UDF increases tone and calls on the side of the Nouveau Centre to further did not enjoy their abbreviation.
Association of UDF, controlled the party MoDemFrançoise Bayroua, Friday reacted to the President of the Nouveau Centre, Hervého Morina about appropriation shortcuts former Giscardovy parties that shortcut may not be used in any medium, under threat of criminal prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced its intention to take ownership of the abbreviation UDF with by François Bayrou nezaslouží bear her heritage after having made the hand left.
Minister of defence, whose party is the partner of the UMP, this strategy should plan confirmed Saturday before the National Council of Nouveau Centre (NC).
This step has support for members of the Hervého de Charetta (former under-UMP now for NC) that you assign ownership of the UDF, because it marks the first had in 2004 to register at the National Institute of industrial property (l ' Institut national de la propriété industrielle).
But on Friday evening, the Committee of the Association UDF directed friends Françoise Bayroua, who do not intend to be vyvlastnit, disembark from his silence and made a formal request to the Minister and the members that have used the abbreviation and give back ownership of the trademarks, under threat of criminal prosecution.
In the last days you increase worrying statements that you design your political movement again take the abbreviation UDF, writes Association in its letter signed 19 of 24 members of the Committee, for example, François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez by MoDem or Senator Jean Arthuis from centrist.
At the same time you confuse it on their promotional materials and on the Welcome to the website of your movement, the name of the Nouveau centre, with the slogan UDF today, they are also signatories to the letter.
As you know, you have no right to use this shortcut, explains UDF Committee that pulls movement NC "immediately delete all mention the names of the UDF from all promotional materials including (their) websites".
Also calls Hervého de Charettea "to forward its ownership of the mark legitimate owners".
If you do not, according to the courts have respected the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, suggesting signatories.
In its letter that UDF "is their political hnutíod 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends "chose" in 2007, "to create competitive movement, as do others in 2002, founded the UMP.
The movement has, therefore, Nouveau centre according to them, any right to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
Also recall that the last Congress UDF voted in 2007 to connect to the MoDem for three years and for the creation of the Committee entrusted with defending "moral and material interests" associations based Valérym Giscardem d ' Estaing.
As regards the Hervého de Charettea, continues, "when the registered mark", not "already three years a member of the UDF", but the UMP.
Skandálním and fraudulently used non-registration of acronyms do so on their own account.
This netaktnost is starting to redesign the offence declare and then ironically convey strategy NC: "it seems to us that both in policy and in everyday life is more valuable to create your own name than to withdraw from the anonymity of fraudulent adoption names that we have the right".
Case Liliane Bettencourtové: François-Marie Banier will be tried for misuse of State weakness.
The Court in Nanterre in the Friday decided to judge by Françoise-Marie Baniera and hand down a judgment that implements State weakness 80 miliardářky to make it part of its assets, it viní its daughter Liliane Bettencourt.
Photographer (62 years), known for its famous photo will be tried 15. and 16. April 2010 to exploit State weakness, which is an offence for which punishment is imposed on the maximum duration of 3 years and a fine of EUR 375 000.
This decision confirms that actually tries to process the affair, which can be marked as family ságu one of the richest families in France, in which each of them mother daughter and fights with the management of cosmetic Empire l ' Oréal.
However, 15. the Criminal Court also ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliany Bettencourtové, which should make the College three doctors.
Dědička and main akcionářka company l ' Oréal always refuse to undergo such tests, certainly not in terms of public prosecutors ' offices in Nanterre during investigations.
Doctors who will be elected on a Friday, should draw up a report to 10. March 2010, and submit comments that might be in Liliana Bettencourt State weakness, and in which period.
I think that it should undertake.
On the matter with the promluvím, after hearing the Advocate-General, Mrs. Bettencourtové, Georges Kiejman.
As regards the lawyer François Bettencourtové-Meyersové, Metznera, the Oliviera decision of the Court welcomed.
It's excellent report (...). Expertise, it appears that with this old Spades, which needs protection, manipuloval (m. Banier), confirmed.
Are the two years, as the only daughter of Liliany Bettencourtové has initiated criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banierovi, fotografovi and všeumělci, viní, that for many years to benefit State weakness of its mother, the gift of a billion eur in the form of cheques, life insurance or images.
But the Liliane Bettencourt always challenged, that would be a photographer, which is considered a long-term friend, processed.
While the Court had to consider the eligibility of actions brought by Mrs Bettencourtovou-Meyersovou, Friday's judicial speech advocates are at times appear in the family hour of truth.
Lawyer Liliany Bettencourtové submitted three letters of his klientka (1999, 2003 and 2005), sent to his solicitor, and has indicated its suspicion against the husband of Françoisy Bettencourtové-Meyersové.
In a letter from 2003, Liliane Bettencourt as lawyer adds: "could you explain my daughter that I Banierovi for 15 years, she once or twice daily.
Since then, what is married, I'm with Françoise never speak ".
Prosecutor in Nanterre again shledalo that stěžovatelky is not legitimate, the opatrovnický judge these days has rejected its application for the initiation of proceedings for the issue of legal protection for its mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is completely unable to participate in the Court, are not under protection or in social services.
No one else will it act ", confirmed the representative of the Chief, Marie-Christine Daubigneyová.
The Court finally ruled that the lawfulness of Mrs Bettencourtové-Meyersové expressed at the time of initiation of the process.
Managerial revolution or end economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our fight economic intelligence was unnecessary.
For more than ten years reminds majors behavior management staff access companies to consumers before the marketing revolution: the collaborators ztotožnili with "values" designated from the mountain, as was previously when it was necessary to get consumer products resulting from the ideas of heads factory technicians.
The customer became a centre of entrepreneurial companies, compared the marketing revolution strategy mining market in the right direction ... Although paternalistic efforts get products different from customer preferences, periodically returning!
Passive workers can lead to fatal demoralizaci.
Suicide in companies France Telecom, DOG, or just the visible parts of the Renault are much rozšířenějšího general phenomenon that affects mainly managerial cadres.
Following demobilisation adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, EI "requires from all interested parties (...) active access and ability to anticipate and requires staff commitments that are completely inconsistent with revenue an authoritarian management.
Therefore, we call on the managerial revolution, which should aim to provide personnel to the Centre of interest of the company as a client.
The relative usefulness of internal poll.
Internal polls-questionnaire submitted by employees of the company as Orange-revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, fear not.
Mainly because I already persuaded himself that in the face of the new situation, the structure of different priority to turn returns ... as always do!
Furthermore, authoritarianism, as pathological risks, the relevance is increased in proportion to its own failures.
And finally, since most managers has a simplified view of human behavior.
Because graduates for engineers, mechanical interpretation of psychology.
Due to adopt the old thought pohodlnosti behavioristickou theory, now again oživenou "neurovědami" from the USA and šířenou without knowledge of scientific institutes and the media.
That is possible, but "flippers" (sic) involvement of managers, showed recent Exploration Agency Ipsos in Figaro. fr, which only has entrenched a management staff in their position of mechanical procedure, inappropriate for today's world.
Identify and measure the factors of mobilization.
Conversely, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern business, the adoption of the final vision of human behavior.
Lies in the integration of the basic postřehu into all projects and practice management for staff in the amounts owed to the company only if it can seem as a means to achieve their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At present, this concept of motivation of workers only study Motivačně functional analysis.
These studies have shown that assesses its undertakings on the basis of predetermined doxy allowing them, through the image of the company terminates, assess what they offer to their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these factors mobilization can managers monitor, anticipate and pre-empted on their "social" and stated its performance management of human resources "on the right.
Thus plating for the development of a sound and effective economic intelligence.
The incidence of Oslo: "just war", Obama earned mixed reports from the right.
The American right Friday welcomed the Barack Obama to present the day before in Oslo, happy with the fact that the holder of the Nobel Prize amount for the year 2009 obhajoval concept "fair war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservative who initially vysmívali grant price Obamovi 9. October, this time prezidentskému expression tleskali, including Sarah Palinové, former kandidátky at viceprezidentku in elections in 2008.
Liked what he stated Palin, múza for the statement by the wings, for the journal, USA today, and added that she is "sometimes" war expressed in their memoirs, which currently are based.
War is, of course, the last thing that Americans wanted to work, but is not required.
All the terrorists there should be retention, believes.
President Obama, who has inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after its předchůdciGeorge w. Bush family, Thursday in Oslo ospravedlňoval police forces use speech to explain its decision to deploy an additional 30 000 troops into Afghanistan, nine days before.
The next opponent, Newt Gingrich Obamův, was that the President did in Oslo "very good".
I think that the speech was very good, blahopřál, former Chairman of the House, that'll appreciate in particular the President's mention of "the existence of evil in the world".
In a way I'm this speech he completely historical, Gingrich during an interview on the radio show "the Takeaway".
Former member, which some considered a possible candidate in the presidential elections, the statement by the year 2012, was pleased by that sees the "left-wing President" recalled members of the Committee for the Nobel Prize, "that they would not be free and able to pass the price for peace, though the use of force was".
According to Michael Gersona, former author of George w. Bush, now editor for the Washington Post, Obama present "very American speech".
Not only is presented as a "světoobčan" as always, but "spoke as US President" and stressed that the Europeans ' lives in a safe, they created the balloon, and that not too many that it was retained, Gerson.
Among the few nespokojenců from the series right include Hawk Bush era, former Ambassador to the UN John Bolton, the speech marked "jednotvárný, vitriolic rant and without inspiration", as indicated on the website of the national Review Online.
To the left of the President, as a democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is dismayed when looking at Baracka Obamu as justifies the use of force.
"When the war zabalíme into a container of Justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people ', warning.
However, the medium-to-wing printing towards President pochvalné opinion.
Although the Los Angeles Times continue to be considered for grant peace Obamovi, evaluate its premature output as "nadvýkon" even for a speaker known for its major.
A speech from Oslo should serve as a guide to international decision in resolving conflicts, the fight against poverty and útlakem ", zaníceně says California journal.
Obama ", signifying that it was necessary to" grow the New York Times, and the expression of trust "for simple and informative".

The new Silicon-Valley
For many years was the secret city, accessible for visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one of ten districts of the city of Moscow in the Soviet Union it was strictly protected site where the secret weapons research.
Today is my County with 216 000 inhabitants, 37 km from Moscow, the Russian "Silicon Valley".
There are important micro-and nanoelektronická research and production centre.
Since September 2008 have open zelenogradští representatives contacts with Frankfurt scientific centre Riedberg-with university institutions and firms Frankfurtského Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There was a lot of reciprocal visits and Wednesday signed in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg "Protocol on close cooperation".
The Russian delegation led by Moscow Yuri Rosljak and vícestarosta prefect of Zelenogradu, Anatoly podepisoval, Frankfurt Smirnov, leading the planning officer Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, behind representatives FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in research on the seminar to the přírodovědeckým Zelenogradu.
Scientific exchange
This is the ongoing scientific exchange.
It also but on economic relations.
Companies will be able to establish FIZu for doggedly Russian market.
Conversely, Russian scientific companies looking to get a contract in Germany.
Zelenograd is significant Russian research institutes and companies.
These include need Moscow Institute of technology, large groups electron Sitronics and Rossijskaja Electronics.

Stuttgartská brake
Dimension Stuttgart 21 are sufficiently prepared.
For fans of project is simply a "new heart of Europe".
Well. S21 is more than the starting station, more than a monstrous edifice, uvrhne capital of Baden-Württemberg on the Decade to the zoufalého civil chaos.
Stuttgart 21 from the spirit of 80. years.
The top station of the tracks, which ended in the town centre, were considered without technical fossils 19. they act as a brake modern rail transport, as was the need for a lot of time on an přepřáhnutí locomotives backwards.
Come stop, take a moment away-so this should work.
And thus disappearing hlavová station: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: transit station, which is roughly half the routes TRANS motorway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava-ten slogan of "the heart of Europe".
Actually begins with S21, although vision of 80. years are no longer compatible with the facts.
Urban planners, throw Yourself very ambitious in hesenském and Bavarian metropolis is the start of construction almost neufinancovatelné.
Since then, there are modern shuttle trains with motor and controlling vehicles on both ends, not hlavová station has problems with zajížděním and vyjížděním.
Anyway: starting with Stuttgartem 21 including new track ICE in Ulm.
Imposed by zemští and municipal politicians.
Track work, also because the risk of the largest infrastructure project in the Republic is borne by the taxpayer, and not the State group.
Urbanisticky can be used as a project yet somehow.
Creates a new urban space which-if we believe your pictures developers-will contain many green.
For railway transport system is S21 malicious.
High water station and the construction of the line are intended for passenger services, which are typically in 80-. the enormous increase in years-připisoval.
If there was competition from cheap flights.
Modern transport policy must go but primarily on the strengthening of freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than freight car on the road.
