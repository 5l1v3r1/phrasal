Association UDF increases tone and calls side Nouveau Center to continue to not enjoying the shortcut.
Association of the UDF party controlled MoDemFrançoise Bayrou on Friday responded to an attempt by President Nouveau Center, Hervé Morin on appropriating shortcuts former Giscardovy Parties agree that the acronym may be used in any medium, under threat of criminal prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced its intention to steal a shortcut with the UDF, François Bayrou that you deserve to bear the inheritance after his hand left.
Defense Minister, whose party is a partner of UMP, had planned the strategy to confirm the Saturday before the National Council Nouveau Movement Center (NC).
This step has the support of the MEP Hervé de Charetta (for ex-UMP is now in NC), who assigns ownership of the brand UDF because it first had in 2004 registered in the National Industrial Property Institute (l'Institut national de la propriété industrielle ).
But on Friday evening, the committee managed by friends of the Association UDF François Bayrou, who do not intend to let expropriate, stepped out of his silence and gave a formal request by the Minister to stop using the acronym and handed back ownership of the mark, on pain of criminal prosecution.
In recent days, have increased concern about the statement that the design of its political movements to re-assume + + acronym UDF, says the Association in a letter signed by 19 of those 24 members of the Committee, which as François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez by modem or Senator Jean Arthuis Alliance of the Centrists.
At the same time you considered it appropriate to put on their promotional materials and on the welcome page of your website name + Nouveau movement, center +, with the slogan + + UDF today, note the signatories to the letter.
As you know, you have no right to use this abbreviation, the committee said UDF seeking movements NC "immediately remove all references to the name of the UDF, including all promotional materials (their) website.
And asking Hervé de Charettea "that gave ownership of legitimate trade mark owners.
Otherwise, turn to the courts to respect the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, the signatories warn.
In his letter indicates that the UDF is a fully-fledged political hnutíod 1978 "and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends have" chosen "departure in 2007," to create a competitive movement, like others in 2002 to form UMP.
Nouveau movement center is not, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
At the same time point out that the last Congress UDF voted in 2007 to connect the modem to three years and to create a committee charged with defending the "moral and material interests" association created Valérym Giscard d'Estaing.
As regards Hervé de Charettea, the committee continues, "when the registered trade mark", not "for three years a member of the UDF, but the UMP.
Scandalous and fraudulently used the absence of registration of acronyms to do so on their own account.
This indiscretion is starting to convert to a criminal offense, claim, and then the irony of the strategy denominated NC: "It seems to us that both in politics and in everyday life is more valuable to create a name for himself than to withdraw from the anonymity of fraudulent adoption names which we have no right.

Case Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier be tried for abuse of state weakness.
The court in Nanterre on Friday decided to sue artist François-Marie Baniera and adjudge whether the state used the weakness of the Eighty Years miliardářky to prepare her for a part of its assets, which it blames her daughter Liliane Bettencourt.
Photographer (62 years), known for his photographs of famous 15th will be judged and 16 April 2010 for misuse of state weakness, which is a criminal offense for which a sentence in a maximum of 3 years and a fine of 375 000.
This decision confirms that the process actually takes place in a case that can be characterized as a family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which each attack a mother and daughter struggling with the management of L'Oreal cosmetics empire.
But 15th Criminal court also ordered the medical examination of 87 year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which should make the College three doctors.
Heiress and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such testing, certainly not on the terms offered to the public prosecutor in Nanterre during the investigation.
Physicians who will be elected on Friday, should produce a report to the 10th March 2010 and also requested to comment whether the Liliane Bettencourt could find in a state of weakness, and in which period.
I think that it undergoes.
The things to her speak, said after the hearing Mrs Bettencourt lawyer, Georges Kiejman.
As the Attorney-Françoise Bettencourt Meyers, Olivier Metzner, he welcomed the court's decision.
It's good news (...). Expertise shows that this old lady who needs protection, manipulated (M. Banier) confirmed.
Are the two years since the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt opened criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banierovi, photographer and všeumělci, which accused the state for years used her mother's weakness to gain the gift of one billion euros producing certified checks, contracts for life insurance or images League .
But Liliane Bettencourt always refused, it would be a photographer, which considers long-term friend, manipulated.
While the court must assess the legitimacy of an action brought by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, Friday court speech advocates are sometimes changed in the family hour of truth.
Attorney Liliane Bettencourt submitted three letters to his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) sent to your notaries, and in which it expressed its mistrust of the husband-Françoise Bettencourt Meyers.
In a letter from 2003, according to Liliane Bettencourt lawyer adds: "could you explain to my daughter, I wrote Banierovi for fifteen years, once or twice a day.
Since that time she married, I could never speak Françoise.
State prosecutor in Nanterre again found that the complainant's conduct was not justified, the more that the guardianship judge in those days rejected its request to initiate proceedings for the issue of legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt is fully able to participate in the court is not under protection or in custody.
No one else for it not to act 'representative confirmed the prosecution, Marie-Christine Daubigneyová.
Finally, the Court held that the validity of Mrs. Bettencourt Meyers-expressed during the initiation process.
Managerial Revolution or the end of the economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence was wasted ...
For more than ten years, recalls the behavior management of large company employees access to business-to-consumer marketing before the revolution: the point is to co-identify themselves with the "values" identified from the mountain, as it once was when it was necessary to impose on the consumer products which have emerged heads of the ideas factory technicians.
That the customer became a center of entrepreneurial companies, compare marketing strategies conquering the market revolution in the right direction ... even if the authoritarian attempts to impose on the products of different customer preferences, returning regularly!
Passive attitude of the staff can lead to fatal demoralization.
Suicides in companies France Telecom, PSA and Renault are just the visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon that affects mostly managerial cadres.
The demobilization adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions, including research and development and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
And indeed, EI "requires all parties (...) active approach and ability to anticipate" and requires commitment from employees who are completely at odds with the authoritarian revenue management.
We therefore call on the managerial revolution, which was designed to bring workers to the center of interest of the company as a client.
The relative usefulness of internal surveys.
Internal polls - as the reply submitted by the employees the company Orange - contribute to the revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately I'm afraid not.
Mainly because I convinced myself that in the face of new situation, the structure of the various branching priority returns to ... you always did!
Furthermore, because that authoritarianism as a pathology of power increases proportionately with the severity of their own failures.
Finally, because most executives have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because graduates of engineers have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For the sake of convenience of thought are acquired by the old behaviorist theory, now re-animated "neurosciences" in the U.S. and widely disseminated without greater knowledge of scientific institutes and the media.
In fact, it is possible to move the "levers" (sic) the involvement of managers, showed a recent survey agency Ipsos Figaro.fr the site, which only strengthens the management personnel in the position of a mechanical procedure, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure factors mobilization.
Conversely, managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises, provides the definitive vision of human behavior.
Lies in the integration of basic insight into all projects and management practices: The staff will make commitments to the firm is only when they appear as a clear means to achieve their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept, the motivation of employees engaged in the study only motivation functional analysis.
These studies showed that their businesses on the basis of predetermined doxy, which will allow them to use images, which the company says, look at what gives them to realize their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these factors, managers can mobilize to control, predict and pre-empted on their "social power", indicating their human resource management "on track".
This creates fertile ground for the development of a sound and effective economic intelligence.
Manifestation of the Oslo "just war" Obama has earned praise from the right.
American right-wingers on Friday welcomed a speech that Barack Obama delivered the day before the Oslo satisfied with the fact that the Nobel Peace Prize for 2009 advocated the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives who initially ridiculed the award Obama 9th October, this time a presidential speech applauded, including Sarah Palin, a former vice-presidential candidate in elections in 2008.
I liked what he said, said Palin, Muse of Right Wing Republican, for the newspaper USA Today, adding that she herself is the subject "sometimes necessary" war, expressed in his memoirs, which was based.
War is obviously the last thing Americans would want to have to work, but it is necessary.
All the terrorists there to be detained, he said.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after its předchůdciGeorge W. Bush on Thursday in Oslo justify the deployment of forces and used the speech to explain his decision to send another 30 000 troops to Afghanistan for nine days before.
Another Obama's opponent, Newt Gingrich, evaluate the president did in Oslo "a very good job."
I think that speech was really good, congratulated the former chairman of the House of Representatives, which especially appreciated the President's mention of "the existence of evil in the world.
In a way, I thought the speech as fully historical, Gingrich said during an interview on radio program "The Takeaway".
A former MP, whom some consider a possible Republican candidate in the presidential elections in 2012, was thrilled to see "leftist president," noted committee members for the Nobel Prize, "that they themselves would not be free and could not pass the price for peace, if the use of force exist.
According to Michael Gershon, a former speechwriter George W. Bush, now editor of Washington Post, Obama gave a "very American expression.
Not only is presented as a "cosmopolitan" as always, but "speaking as an American President" and reminded Europeans that "they live in a safe bubble they created themselves and that they do too much for it to keep it" evaluated Gerson.
Among the few malcontents from the right is the hawk Bush era, former UN ambassador John Bolton, who has described as "dull, turgid and without inspiration," as stated on National Review Online.
The left of the President, as the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is appalled at the sight of Barack Obama to justify the use of force.
"When the war packed into a container of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, moderate-leftist press is of the opinion of the President of praise.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to award the Peace Prize Obama premature reviewed his output as "nadvýkon" and orator known for his talent.
Speech Oslo should serve as a guide to international decisions in resolving conflicts, the fight against poverty and oppression, "fervently states California newspaper.
Obama "speech that was said to be" evaluated the New York Times, and a sign marked "for the simple and informative.

Turkish justice for the Kurdish party disbanded and this decision brings with it grave consequences.
Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday decided to cancel the main pro-Kurdish party in the country. The decision immediately triggered a protest demonstration s in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and Istanbul.
This decision may greatly complicate the task of government, which attempts to provide a hand of friendship to the Kurdish community and try to end 25 years of conflict.

The decision is a continuation of a process initiated in 2007, the Court of Cassation Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkayem, which accuses the DTP of obedience to the "orders" Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is a legal political showcase PKK rebels.
Page assures that the PKK has no "essential link", but refuses to designate a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
Verdict comes at a time when the government gives the Kurdish community, a friendly hand and offers a range of measures to strengthen their rights and attempts to restrict aid to the Kurds and the PKK to end the conflict.
DTP executives confirmed that the dissolution of the parties could lead to a renewal of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where degenerated in recent weeks, many demonstrations against the conditions under which the detained PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan in clashes with police.

Police used tear grenades and water cannons, the demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails again and fired stones from slings.
Also demonstrated in Istanbul about a hundred people.
After delivery of the verdict, Mr. Türk said that the decision of justice "will deepen despair.
Turkey is not the question (the Kurds, note. Red.) Resolved the ban, said in the press.
The government, consisting of a party came from the Islamist movement, also condemned the decision.
We are against the principle of party interference.
This does not solve anything, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is an absolute shooting democratic proposals, the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can wait for reaction from the PKK, he said.
On Thursday, the PKK subscribed to one of the most deadly attacks in the north of Turkey, which killed three days earlier seven soldiers.
New Silicon-Valley
For years the city paid for the secret, inaccessible to visitors from the west.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital city of Moscow, the Soviet Union that was closely guarded site where there is carried a secret weapons research.
Today is considered to be the district with 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers away from Moscow's center, the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Are placed significant micro-and nanoelectronics research and manufacturing centers.
Since September 2008 established contacts with representatives zelenogradští scientific frankfurtským center Riedberg - with university institutions and firms Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There was a number of reciprocal visits and signed on Wednesday in Frankfurt Zelenograd Ridberg a "Protocol for close cooperation.
Russian delegation was led by Moscow vícestarosta Yuri Rosljak and the prefect of Zelenograd, Anatoly Smirnov, head of the Frankfurt signed Planning Officer Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives will go FIZ and small and medium enterprises engaged in research at a seminar přírodovědeckým in Zelenograd.
Scientific Exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZu firms will be allowed to implant in the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian companies want to get scientific contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd Russia is home to major research institutes and companies.
These should include the Moscow Institute of Electron Technology, large corporations and Sitronics Rossiyskaya Electronics.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planning" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literal translation of "Green City") received its name from the wooded hilly landscape, which are placed in research facilities.
Stuttgart brake
Dimension Stuttgart 21 simply can not adequately prepare.
For fans of the project is quite simply a "new heart of Europe".
Well. S21 is more than running the station, more than a monstrous building, which throws the capital of Baden-Württemberg for a decade building a desperate chaos.
Stuttgart 21 arose from the spirit of 80th years.
Head station with tracks that ended in the city center, were then considered the traffic and technical fossils 19th century, which act as brakes of modern rail transportation, it was enormous need much time to přepřáhnutí locomotive from back to front.
Go, stop for a moment, go on - so it should work.
Therefore disappearing head station: Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit station, which lies roughly in the middle of the route of trans-European highway between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - hence the slogan of "the heart of Europe".
Indeed, starting with S21, although the vision of the 80 years are no longer compatible with reality.
Ourselves very ambitious designers know that the Hessen and Bavarian metropolis is the start of construction almost neufinancovatelné.
Since then, as there are modern shuttle trains and motor vehicles to control both ends, no head station has problems zajížděním and vyjížděním.
Still: It starts with the Stuttgart 21, with a new track ICE to Ulm.
Asserting that the prefects and municipal politicians.
Tracks together, and because the greatest risk of individual infrastructure project in the republic bears the taxpayer and not the state concern.
Urban, the project is still some way to apologize.
Provides a new urban space, which - if we believe the computer images of designers - will contain a lot of greenery.
For rail transport system is detrimental S21.
Transit station and the construction of the line are designed for passenger transport, which - typically in the 80 years - highlighted the huge increase.
Then there was competition from cheap flights.
Modern transport policy must go but first and foremost on enhancing freight rail transport as is much greener than the freight car on the road.
