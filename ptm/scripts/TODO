Automate the following database actions:
 1) User setup
  -> This should include setting up both human and agent (MT) users
 2) Loading source texts
 3) Loading MT (Google Translate?) target texts for each source text.

Exact pre-processing for each language:
 1) Tokenization
 2) Segmentation (if any)
