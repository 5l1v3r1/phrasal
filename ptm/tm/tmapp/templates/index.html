Stanford Translation Study

{% block content %}

<p>Thank you for helping us with this experiment! We are a group of researchers in the <a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science Department at Stanford University</a> working on translation interfaces. Our goal is to how study how translators, like you, use machine-assisted translation systems.</p>

<p><b>Privacy</b>: During the study, we will record your responses (i.e., translations), keystrokes, mouse actions, and browser settings. We will also ask you to fill out two surveys on your demographic information and about your experience with this study. We will not collect any other personal information.</p>

<p><b>Participation</b>: Your participation in this experiment is voluntary. You may stop at any time without any penalty. However, you will only be paid for a completed study. Full payment is contingent on finishing the translation tasks in continuous sessions.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or feedback, please contact <a href="mailto:spenceg@stanford.edu">Spence Green</a>.</p>
