<h3>Experiment Goals: Translation Speed &amp; Quality</h3>

<p>During the study, translate the documents as quickly and as accurately as you can.</p>

<p><b>Speed</b>: Once you start working on a document, you <b>may not idle for longer than 3 minutes</b> within a single session. If you pause---meaning an absence of keyboard or mouse input---for 3 continuous minutes, your session will be automatically terminated. The payment for the equivalent number of words will be deducted from your final pay. Continuing to translate will reset the &ldquo;idle timer.&rdquo; Otherwise, you will not be penalized or rewarded for total amount of time you spend on a translation.</p> 

<p><b>Quality</b>: Once you submit a translated document, you will not have another opportunity to edit it. Make sure that your translation is in good shape before you press the submit button!</p>

<h3>Overview of the Experiment</h3>

<p>This website will administer the translation job, which is organized into two modules separated by a break:</p>

<ul>
<li>Translation Module #1 (about 1,200 source words)</li>
<li>Break (not timed)</li>
<li>Translation Module #2 (about 1,200 source words)</li>
<li>Exit Survey</li>
</ul>

<p>We ask that you complete each translation module in a continuous session. Once you complete Module #1, the website will prompt you to take a break, and the idle timer will be disabled. Get up, go to the bathroom, get some coffee: whatever you need to stay productive. We expect that you'll take about 15 minutes, and no more than an hour. We require that you complete both modules on the same day.</p>

<h3>Job Description and Requirements</h3>

<p>You will be asked to translate two sets of documents from <b>{{ src_lang }}</b> to <b>{{ tgt_lang }}</b>.</p>

<p>The document may be unrelated to each other. You will be presented with paragraphs selected from the documents. You will see the sentences from these paragraphs, in the same order in which they appear in the original document.</p>

<p>This text comes from technical domains, so it will challenge you. Please make sure that your {{ tgt_lang }} translation:
<ul>
<li>Is faithful to the original text in both meaning and style</li>
<li>Is grammatical, fluent, and natural-sounding</li>
<li>Does not add or delete information from the original text</li>
<li>Does not contain any spelling errors</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>When creating your translation, you:
<ul>
<li><b>May use</b> dictionaries, either offline or online (e.g., <a href="http://www.wordreference.com" target="_blank">WordReference</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>However:
<ul>
<li><b>Do not use</b> any other automatic/machine translation systems (e.g., Google Translate, Trados, etc.)</li>
<li><b>Do not use</b> translation memories or term bases</li>
<li><b>Do not use</b> browser plugins or extensions</li>
</ul>

<p>We will check the translations you submit against those produced by various machine translation systems. We're trying to understand how this specific CAT system works, so please help us by not using other machine assistance.</p>

<p>The two translation modules have different interfaces.</p>

<h3>Translation Interface A (Post-edit)</h3>

<p>You will be presented with {{ src_lang }} documents in a sequence. The interface will contain textboxes to enter {{ tgt_lang }} translations. Each textbox will be pre-populated with a suggested {{ tgt_lang }} translation. You may accept, edit, or delete the suggested translation. Please work as quickly and as accurately as you can. The "idle timer," which limits your pauses to 3 minutes, is located at the bottom of your browser window. If you do not complete the translation before the idle timer expires, then the incomplete translation will be submitted for you. The site will then redirect you to the next document.</p>

<h3>Translation Interface B (Interactive)</h3>

<p>You will be presented with {{ src_lang }} documents in a sequence. The interface will provide several interactive aids to help you translate each document into {{ tgt_lang }}. The objective remains the same: translate each document as quickly and as accurately as you can. As before, the "idle timer" will appear at the bottom of your browser window.</p>

<h3>Interactive Interface Tutorial</h3>
<p>The interactive interface offers both source and target aids. The suggestions update as you type. You may select suggestions via the keyboard and mouse. Please watch the following tutorial, which demonstrates the several translation aids.</p>

<strong>TODO: Screencast + YouTube link</strong>

<p>Once you have watched the tutorial, please translate a few documents using the two interfaces.</p>

<p>When you press the button below, the translator workbench will open. The workbench will alternate between the post-edit and interactive modes. Take your time. You will be paid for these translations, but the idle timer will not be present. We want you to develop some proficiency with the interfaces prior to starting the experiment.</p>

<p>When you feel proficient, please click the link at the bottom of the workbench interface to return to the homepage. Then you can start the experiment.</p>
