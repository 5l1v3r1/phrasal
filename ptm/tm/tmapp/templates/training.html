<p>Thank you for agreeing to help us with this experiment! We are a group of researchers in the <a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science Department at Stanford University</a> working on new translation interfaces. Our goal is to create interfaces that will improve both translator productivity and translation quality. To that end, your keystrokes and mouse actions will be recorded while you work. <b>No personal information will be recorded except for the anonymous survey data.</b> We will study the method that you and other translators like you used to translate sentences.</p>

<p>You will be asked to translate two sets of documents from <span style="font-weight:bold">{{ src_lang }}</span> to <span style="font-weight:bold">{{ tgt_lang }}</span>. Translate the documents as quickly and as accurately as you can. Once you start a translation, you may pause for no longer than 3 minutes during the session. If you pause for longer than 3 minutes, then your current translation will be automatically submitted. For each sentence that you exceed the "idle timer," we will deduct that many words from the final price that you are paid.</p>

<p>Once you submit a document translation, you will not have another opportunity to edit or proofread it. Make sure that your translation is in good shape before you press the submit button!</p>

<p>This job is the first in a series of translation studies that we are running over the next few months. If you submit good translations, then we will ask you to join us for future studies.</p>

<h3>Job Description and Requirements</h3>
<p>Our website will administer the translation job, which is organized into two modules separated by a break:</p>

<ul>
<li>Translation Module #1 (about TODO words)</li>
<li>Break (untimed)</li>
<li>Translation Module #2 (about TODO words)</li>
<li>Survey (untimed; about 5min. to complete)</li>
</ul>

<p>We ask that you complete the whole job in a single session. Once you complete Module #1, the website will prompt you to take a break, and the timer will be disabled. Get up, go to the bathroom, get some coffee: whatever you need to stay productive. We expect that you'll take about 15 minutes, and no more than an hour. We require that you complete both modules on the same day.</p>

<p>The text that you will be asked to translate comes from several unrelated documents. We selected paragraphs from these documents, the sentences of which you will see in the order in which they appeared in the document. We expect that the sentences will challenge you. Please make sure that your {{ tgt_lang }} translation:
<ul>
<li>Is faithful to the original text in both meaning and style</li>
<li>Is grammatical, fluent, and natural-sounding</li>
<li>Does not add or delete information from the original text</li>
<li>Does not contain any spelling errors</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>When creating your translation, please do not use:
<ul>
<li>External automatic/machine translation systems (for example, Google Translate, Trados, etc.)</li>
<li>Translation memories or term bases</li>
<li>Browser plugins or extensions</li>
</ul>
You <b>may</b> use dictionaries, either online (for example, <a href="http://www.wordreference.com" target="_blank">WordReference</a>) or offline.
</p>

<p>We will check the translations you submit against those produced by various machine translation systems. We're curious to know how humans work (we already know a lot about machines!). Please help us by not using machine assistance.</p>

<p>Each translation module has a different interface. The website will randomly choose which interface to show you in each of the translation modules.</p>

<h3>Translation Interface A (Post-edit)</h3>
<p>You will be presented with {{ src_lang }} documents in a sequence. The interface will contain textboxes to enter {{ tgt_lang }} translations. Each textbox will be pre-populated with a suggested {{ tgt_lang }} translation. You may accept, edit, or delete the suggested translation. Please work as quickly and as accurately as you can. The "idle timer," which limits your pauses to 3 minutes, is located at the bottom left of your browser window. If you do not complete the translation before the idle timer expires, then the incomplete translation will be submitted for you. The site will then redirect you to the next document.</p>

<h3>Translation Interface B (Interactive)</h3>
<p>You will be presented with {{ src_lang }} documents in a sequence. The interface will provide several interactive aids to help you translate each document into {{ tgt_lang }}. The objective remains the same: translate each document as quickly and as accurately as you can. As before, the "idle timer" will appear at the bottom left of your browser window.</p>

<h3>Interactive Interface Tutorial</h3>
<p>The interactive interface offers both source and target aids. The suggestions update as you type. You may select suggestions via the keyboard and mouse. Please watch the following tutorial, which demonstrates the several translation aids.</p>

<h3>Browser Information</h3>
<p>The following data about your web browser will be recorded, as part of your participation in this experiment.</p>
<input type="hidden" name="BrowserLog" id="BrowserLog"></input>
<div id="BrowserReport" style="padding: 0 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; font-family: PT_Mono, monospace; font-size: 8pt; color: #333">
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0"><b>Your browser is:</b></p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0" id="BrowserUserAgent"></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0"><b>Your browser supports:</b></p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0" id="BrowserSupport"></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0"><b>Your browser does not support:</b></p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0" id="BrowserNoSupport"></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0"><b>Your browser passed the following tests:</b></p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0" id="BrowserPass"></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0"><b>Your browser did not pass the following tests:</b></p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0" id="BrowserNoPass"></p>
</div>

{% if show_ui_link %}
<p>Once you have watched the tutorial, please translate a few documents using the new interface. Take your time. You will be paid for these translations, but the idle timer will not be present. We want you to develop some proficiency with the interface prior to starting the experiment. When you have translated a few documents, please click the link at the bottom of the interface to return to this page. Then you can start the experiment.</p>
