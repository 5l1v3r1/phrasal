## PHRASAL EXPERIMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

phrasal.sh supports a passive experimental management system (EMS). The EMS records to the results of experimental runs, but does not support active configuration of runs. 

The EMS reporting feature requires a web server that supports server-side includes (SSI). At Stanford we use Apache.

To configure the reporting feature, follow these steps:

1) In phrasal.sh:
 a) Change the REPORTING_DIR variable to a valid path. Results, ini, and vars files will be copied to this directory.
 b) Set the RESULTS_FILE variable. phrasal.sh will write the results of runs to this file.

2) Create a directory that is accessible from your web server. In that directory, clone the tablesorter jquery plugin:

  git clone https://github.com/christianbach/tablesorter.git

3) Copy phrasal-ems.html to the web server directory. Then open the file and search for "TODO". Update the "include" statement on the next line to the path of RESULTS_FILE.

4) You can create different views by repeating (1b) and (3).
