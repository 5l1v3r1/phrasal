## PHRASAL EXPERIMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

phrasal.sh supports a passive experimental management system (EMS). The EMS records to the results of experimental runs, but does not support active configuration of runs. 

The EMS reporting feature requires a web server that supports server-side includes (SSI). At Stanford we use Apache.

To configure the reporting feature, follow these steps:

1) Create a directory under the root of your web server. In that directory, clone the tablesorter jquery plugin:

  git clone https://github.com/christianbach/tablesorter.git

2) In phrasal.sh:
 a) Change the REPORTING_DIR variable to (1). Results, ini, and vars files will be copied to this directory. 
 b) Set the RESULTS_FILE variable. phrasal.sh will write experimental results to this file. IMPORTANT: this file should be somewhere under the web server root, i.e., a path accessible by the server.

3) Copy phrasal-ems.html to (1). Open the file and search for "TODO". Update the "include" statement to the path of RESULTS_FILE.

4) You can create different views by repeating (2b) and (3).
