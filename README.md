Dependencies:
=============

The Phrasal decoder requires that you also install the latest Stanford CoreNLP software package, which can be downloaded from:

http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml

Some advanced Phrasal features have external dependencies. A script to fetch
and configure these dependencies is included in scripts/get-dependencies.sh. If you are compiling Phrasal,
then the "ant compile" target automatically runs this script for you.
