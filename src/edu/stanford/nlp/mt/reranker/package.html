  The GALE package collects efforts for the <a href="http://projects.ldc.upenn.edu/gale/">GALE</a> project.
  For now the classes in this package are related to Chinese to English machine translation system.
  The gale package started with the implementatiion of a reranking system built on top of N-best lists generated
  from other MT decoders, such as Moses or Hiero.
</p>

<p>
  There are 2 main standalone classes in this package: {@link mt.reranker.LegacyFeatureExtractor} and
  {@link mt.reranker.NBest}.
