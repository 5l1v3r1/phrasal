<p>
	Reimplementation of the syntactic MT models described in (Galley et
	al., 2004; Galley et al., 2006), plus some features not available in
	the original implementation: Markovization (in progress) and
	filtering against a given dev/test set. Please do not redistribute,
	since it would lead to serious patent issues with Language Weaver.
