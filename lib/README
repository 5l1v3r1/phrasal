README for $JAVANLP_HOME/mt/lib

This directory is intended to contain only *current and necessary*
.jar files used with the MT branch of JavaNLP. If also used by core
JavaNLP packages, these .jar files should not appear in this
directory.  Each jar file should be without its version number but
include a corresponding fully qualified source .zip file in the libsrc
folder.  For example, if there is a file lib/ra.jar there should be a
corresponding and up-to-date libsrc/ra-0.1.8-src.zip.

Outdated or redundant .jar files should NOT be kept here, but should
be stored instead in /u/nlp/java/liball.  That directory should also
include copies of the current .jar files in this directory, but with
version numbers in the name.  Example: colt1.0.3.jar.

If you're adding a new .jar to the repository, please add the jar
itself and its source zip AND update the Eclipse .classpath file to 
include the jar and a path to its source.  Please also update this
file with information about the jar.  Any .jar files which appear in
this directory should be listed in this file, with the following
information:
